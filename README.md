# SYS320-Automation-Scripting
This is my repository for my SYS-320 Automation and Scripting class. 

This repository is a collection of all the assignments that I did for my automation and scripting class. This class focused on using Python 3 and PowerShell to script various tasks. The repository structure is based on each week of class. The first half of the semester was spent working with Python. We transitioned to PowerShell during week 10.
